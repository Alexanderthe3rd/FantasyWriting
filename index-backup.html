  <!--About Section-->
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I have many plans for the destiny of this blog.
    Its a work in progress. I am going to start this project by adding my novel that I ve been trying to write for many years.
    Lots of life challenges as you all experience has always drifted me off from writing.
    As ages have passed me, an idea sprang in to me. The idea is this blog that I have setup.
  </p>
  <p>My conscience believes that this Blog might or will help me,
    encourage me and push me in completing the story and as well improving it.
    AND it will as well help me in creating other things that I wished to do in this life.
  </p>
